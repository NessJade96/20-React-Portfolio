# 20-React-Portfolio
Being a web developer means being part of a community. I need a place to share my projects not only if I'm applying for jobs or working as a freelancer but also so that I can share my work with fellow developers and collaborate on future projects.  Now that I've completed multiple projects, I am to create a portfolio, using my new React skills to help be set apart from other developers whose portfolios donâ€™t use the latest technologies.
