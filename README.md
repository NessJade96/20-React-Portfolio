# 20-React-Portfolio

## Description:

Being a web developer means being part of a community. I need a place to share my projects not only if I'm applying for jobs or working as a freelancer but also so that I can share my work with fellow developers and collaborate on future projects. Now that I've completed multiple projects, I am to create a portfolio, using my new React skills to help be set apart from other developers whose portfolios donâ€™t use the latest technologies.

## User Setup: // need to udpate!

To use this at home, in your terminal run the following commands to invoke the application:
`npm i` to install packages,
then `npm run start` starts the live server.

## User Story

```md
AS AN employer looking for candidates with experience building single-page applications
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed React portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
```
